# align-content

It helps **aligning a flex container's items along the cross-axis**, similar to what align-items do. But in order to work the items must be **spanned across multiple lines** which can be done by assigning *width to each box and then adding the flex-wrap property in the container itself*.  
#### Note, this property has no effect when the flexbox has only a single line.
