# order

Flex items are displayed in the **same order** as they appear in the source document by default.  
The *order property can be used to change this ordering*.

The **default-value** is equal to **0**.  
The values can be **set to either positive or negative** depending upon the order that you want.

##### Caveat: In case you are copying some text, then youhave to copy in the same order, irrespective of order that the elements are in.
