# align-self

The **align-self** property is a sub-property of the *Flexible Box Layout module*.  

***It makes possible to override the align-items value for specific flex items.***

The align-self property accepts the same 5 values as the align-items:

1. **flex-start**: cross-start margin edge of the item is placed on the cross-start line
2. **flex-end**: cross-end margin edge of the item is placed on the cross-end line
3. **center**: item is centered in the cross-axis
4. **baseline**: items are aligned such as their baseline are aligned
5. **stretch (default)**: stretch to fill the container (still respect min-width/max-width)
