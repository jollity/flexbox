# Flex-wrapping and columns

##### How flex-box works normally?  (with flex-wrap: nowrap (default value))
If you **specify the dimensions** for the flex items, then flexbox will try to **adjust the items with the respective dimensions** that you have provided.  

But in case, **flexbox is not able to follow** the dimensions that you give it, then it will make sure to **evenly spread/distribute the space available into the items**.
